# SimulatedComputer
This collection of files creates the functions of a simulated computer mostly coded in Java as well as A64 Assembly Language.

ALU.java and Binary.java work together to simulate the arithmetic and logic unit as well as the binary operations of an ARMv8 processor.

Assembler.java, LabelOffset.java, and Opcode.java work together to take in .data and .code files given by Dr. Aarathi Prasad of Skidmore College to assemble the information.

CPU.java implements a simple CPU based on the ARMv8 datapath.

CacheMemory.java simulates how cache stores memory.
